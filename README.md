OpenDDS 
======== 

[OpenDDS](http://www.opendds.org/) is an open-source C++
implementation of the Object Management Group's specification "Data
Distribution Service for Real-time Systems". OpenDDS is built on the
[ACE](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/ACE-overview.html)
abstraction layer to provide platform portability. OpenDDS also
leverages capabilities of
[TAO](http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/TAO-overview.html), such
as its IDL compiler and as the basis of the OpenDDS DCPS Information
Repository (DCPSInfoRepo).
